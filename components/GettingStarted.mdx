To connect your app to Geobase, configure these environment variables. Include them in a `.env.local` file for local development.

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEOBASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.geobase.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEOBASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_GEOBASE_PROJECT_ANON_KEY
```

You can locate the project reference and anon key in your Geobase project settings.

### Local Development

- Set Node.js version: Use Node version 21:
  ```bash
  nvm use 21
  ```
- Install dependencies: Use your preferred package manager:
  ```bash
  npm install
  # or
  yarn
  # or
  pnpm install
  ```
- Start the development server with HTTPS enabled:
  ```bash
  npm run dev --experimental-https
  # or
  yarn dev --experimental-https
  # or
  pnpm dev --experimental-https
  ```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note: Without `--experimental-https`, the email verification links might redirect to `https://localhost:3000/...`, causing errors. You can navigate manually by removing `https` from the URL if needed.
</Callout>

Access the project at `https://localhost:3000`.
