# Getting Started for Data Scientists

## Introduction
Welcome to the Geobase guide for data scientists. This section covers tools and techniques for analyzing geospatial data using Python and popular data science libraries.

## What You'll Learn
- Working with GeoPandas and Geobase
- Using GeoParquet for efficient data storage
- Geocoding and spatial analysis

## Available Tools
1. **GeoPandas Integration**
   - Reading and writing spatial data
   - Coordinate system transformations
   - Spatial operations

2. **GeoParquet Support**
   - Efficient data storage
   - Fast data loading
   - Interoperability with other tools

3. **Geocoding**
   - Address to coordinate conversion
   - Reverse geocoding
   - Batch processing
