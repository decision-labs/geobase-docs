# Data Imports

There are many ways to import data into Geobase. But we will start with focusing on OpenStreetMap data as it is the largest source of geospatial data on the planet. It has a licence that allows us to use it freely.

## Importing using `osm2pgsql`

The most powerful tool for importing OpenStreetMap data is `osm2pgsql`. It is a command line tool that can import OpenStreetMap data into a PostgreSQL database.

By the end of this you will have some buildings data for a region of your choice imported into your Geobase project.
