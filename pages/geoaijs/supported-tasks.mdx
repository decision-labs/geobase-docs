## Getting Started

Choose a task based on your specific needs:

1. **General Object Detection** - Start with [Object Detection](./object-detection.md) for basic use cases
2. **Custom Objects** - Use [Zero-Shot Object Detection](./zero-shot-object-detection.md) for objects not in standard datasets
3. **Precise Boundaries** - Try [Mask Generation](./mask-generation.md) when you need exact object outlines
4. **Specialized Detection** - Select task-specific models for optimal performance

## Documentation Structure

Each task documentation includes:

- **Quick Start** - Minimal code example to get started immediately
- **Available Models** - Model variants and their specific use cases  
- **Capabilities** - Detailed breakdown of what the model can detect
- **Parameters** - Complete input/output parameters and configuration options
- **Best Practices** - Optimization tips and recommended patterns
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and their solutions

## Next Steps

- Start with the [Object Detection](./supported-tasks/object-detection.md) tutorial if you're new to GeoAI.js
- Explore our [API Reference](/geoaijs/api-reference) for detailed technical documentation
- Check out [Performance Optimization](/geoaijs/guides/performance-optimization.md) for production tips

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new task documentation:

1. Use the [object-detection.md](./object-detection.md) file as a template
2. Follow the established structure and formatting guidelines
3. Include comprehensive performance metrics and practical examples
4. Add cross-references to related models and tasks
5. Update this README with the new task entry in the appropriate table
